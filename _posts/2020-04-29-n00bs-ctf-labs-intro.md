The Infosec Institute hosts a capture the flag (CTF) excercise called "n00bs CTF Labs". 
The n00bs CTF Labs can be found by performing a quick Google

Although the original bounty for the challenge has already been
claimed, new cyber-security professionals can use the excercise
to help improve their skills and methodology.

On the site, you will also be able to gain access to another CTF
called, Practical Web Hacking.
